# ONS-Charge-Prediction
This repository focuses on using a Support Vector Machine for Regression (SVR) on the prediction of electrical charge using the dataset of Brazil's National Operator of the Electrical System (ONS). A Grid Search is used for the hyperparameter selection of the SVR and it's used a trimestral lag for the prediction.
